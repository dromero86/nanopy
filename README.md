# nanopy
Microframework highly scalable in python

# What is it?

A simple frame work in which able implement MVC, running runtime code as PHP, very few libraries (almost standard python) and also friendly to the environment (windows and unix).


# What is the objective?

Fast and scalable Development


# What combines?

- Easy as Codeigniter
- handling paths as Java
- Unicode handling
- Multipurpose: web, desktop, service

# The idea
The idea is that you can run visual applications with some conventions as MVC, KISS or DRY and in turn you can implement calls to other windows like web (offline using sessions) and also you can deploy web applications without losing the richness of working with frameworks.

In turn, if you want intergrar a graphical window system as GTK, QT, WX, TK, etc, or if you want to program for android using SL4A also you can create scalable applications.
